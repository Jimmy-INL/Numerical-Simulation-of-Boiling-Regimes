# Numerical-Simulation-of-Boiling-Regimes
# Boiling is a complex phenomenon to model and to validate. It is one of the most challenging
# physics of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), due to its multi-phase nature and the presence
of dynamic interfaces. 
In this project the OpenFOAM multiphase solver-interPhaseChangeFoam is modified work done by Anderson [1].
