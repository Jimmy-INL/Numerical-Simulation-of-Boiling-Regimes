# Numerical-Simulation-of-Boiling-Regimes
Boiling is a complex phenomenon to model and to validate. It is one of the most challenging
physics of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), due to its multi-phase nature and the presence
of dynamic interfaces. In this project the OpenFOAM multiphase solver-interPhaseChangeFoam
is modified work done by Anderson [1]. This project proves the ability of the modified interPhaseChangeFoam solver
in prediction of phase change due to heat transfer.
